# Kubernetes Homelab 

This repository contains my self-hosted Kubernetes homelab, which I use to learn, experiment, and practice real-world DevOps and SRE concepts.

I work with Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure professionally, and this homelab helps me understand the full lifecycle of running applications from deployment and secrets to monitoring, upgrades, and day-to-day operations.
Everything here is built and managed using a GitOps approach.
